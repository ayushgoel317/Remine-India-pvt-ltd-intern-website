           <p class="subpara">United States businesses generate an immense amount of electronic waste in their day-to-day activities. Every year, we throw away $55 billion worth of e-waste, which damages the environment and wastes valuable materials.

            But how do we solve this?
            
            Electronic recycling can be the perfect solution for businesses electronic waste. It helps by lowering your business costs, improves your environmental standing, and rids the workplace of unnecessary clutter. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subpara">
                When it comes to spending their hard-earned dollars, customers have a lot of choices amongst companies that sell goods and services, and how a particular company stands regarding to its environmental position factors into those decisions. Environmental scandals can tarnish a company’s image while being green can give it a boost.

                You should make a point of discussing your commitment to the environment in your marketing materials, pointing out that you recycle your electronic waste that other companies would simply throw away and the benefits to the recycling process.

                When you recycle your e-waste, you are not only helping the environment, but you are also changing how people view your company.

            Recycling your old technology doesnot feel like it is a massive step toward reaching environmental goals; after all, you are often simply choosing to leave your old devices with a technology recycler, rather than disposing of them yourself. However, there are several distinctive environmental benefits you will receive by recycling your old electronics.

            Recycling often involves a number of different strategies and approaches. For starters, your technology recycler will eradicate the data on your old devices, maintaining regulatory compliance and keeping your data secure. From there, they may refurbish the old devices for future use or disassemble them into their base components.
           </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subpara">
                First, technology recycling allows individuals and businesses to reuse old resources. In some cases, your entire old devices may be reused by another company or individual, giving them new life. In other cases, your devices will be stripped of valuable components like gold and silicon, which can be reused in future applications.

                Either way, this reduces the demand for new resources. If you recycle old minerals, we don’t need to mine new ones. If you refurbish your old devices, we don’t need to produce and ship new ones. Collectively, this reduces energy consumption, resource consumption, and pollution dramatically.

            6 Key Features of a Successful Internal Redeployment Strategy
           </p>

           1.<u>Initial</u> inventorying Before you can start the collection process, it’s important to take inventory of what you currently have. You should note any and all devices in your possession, and decide how you want to handle them. Should these devices be refurbished, or simply recycled?
           </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subpara">
           2. <u>Security</u> Refurbishing and redeploying your old devices can open the door to security vulnerabilities if you aren’t careful; if your data isn’t fully eradicated, or if your devices are lost or unattended at any point in the redeployment process, it could represent a weakness in your security strategy.
            </p>
            <p class="subpara">
           3. <u>Compliance</u> Depending on your industry and location, you may be subject to a number of laws regarding how you store and handle data (particularly consumer data). You’ll need an internal redeployment partner who’s certified, and capable of ensuring your full compliance with these laws. 
            </p>
            <p class="subpara">
            4. <u>Documentation</u> There should be documentation at every stage of the internal redeployment process, from inventorying and shipping to reports on data eradication and internal distribution.

Just as it is critical to properly configure an asset for use, it’s even more vital that it is recycled appropriately. This helps companies eliminate risk while ensuring the maximum return of investment.
